# Parsing HTML

This is an example of building a basic HTML parser to start extracting structured data from Wikipedia. It's intended to support a blog post I am writing and is not really intended for any serious use.

## Requirements

If you want to run this code directly, you will need to be using Node v14+ as I am using ECMAScript modules. (I built this project using Node v14.3.0)
